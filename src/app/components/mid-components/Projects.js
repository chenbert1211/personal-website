      summary: `Dungeon Attack is a dynamic HTML canvas-based game that I built from the ground up with JavaScript. I integrated multiple enemy AI routines and animation systems, enhancing realism in how enemies respond to player movement. By implementing gravity, movement, actions, and particle effects, the game delivers a fast-paced and visually engaging experience. This project honed my understanding of real-time rendering and responsive controls, culminating in an immersive environment that keeps players entertained.`,
